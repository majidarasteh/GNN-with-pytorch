Introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with PyTorch

In this section, we will explore Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using PyTorch, a powerful framework for deep learning on graph-structured data. GNNs have become essential for tasks involving relational data, such as social networks, molecular structures, and recommendation systems.

This lecture aims to provide a clear and practical introduction to GNNs, covering fundamental concepts and implementation techniques. I hope you find it insightful and applicable to your projects!
