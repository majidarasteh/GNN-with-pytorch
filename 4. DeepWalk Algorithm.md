## DeepWalk Algorithm: A Foundational Graph Embedding Method
DeepWalk is a pioneering **unsupervised graph** embedding technique that learns low-dimensional vector representations of nodes by leveraging **random walks** and **Skip-gram** (from NLP). It is particularly effective for preserving community structure in graphs.  
In DeepWalk, the similarity between two nodes $u$ and $v$ in the original graph space is implicitly defined by the probability of reaching $u$ via a random walk starting at $v$. This captures higher-order neighborhood relationships beyond immediate adjacency.  

**A) Key Components:**  

 1. **Random Walk Length ($T$):** $T$ is a hyperparameter controlling how far the walk explores from the starting node.  
    - Short walk (small $T$):is a hyperparameter controlling how far the walk explores from the starting node.
    - Long walks (larg $T$): Encode global, multi-hop relationships (macroscopic structure).
 2. **Similarity Definition:** Computed empirically by simulating many random walks.   
    - $sim(u,v):$ Probability of visiting $u$ in a $T-step$ walk starting at $v$. For example, if $T=3$, measures the likelihood of reaching $u$ within 3 steps from $v$.

**B) Role of $T$ in DeepWalk**   
Controls the trade-off between local and global similarity.

**C) How $T$ affects embeddings**  
 1. Short $T$: Embeddings prioritize direct connections (like friend-of-friend in social networks).
 2. Long $T$: Embeddings reflect broader roles (e.g., nodes in the same community even if not directly linked).

**D) Choosing $T$ in Practice**  
 1. Default: Start with $T=40$ (common in literature).
 2. Link prediction: Prefer shorter $T$ (2-10).
 3. Community detection: Use longer $T$ (20-80).
    
For example, For a social network with dense communities: set $T=30$ to capture both close friendships (local) and group affiliations (global).
