# Graph Attention Network (GAT) 
**Graph Attention Network (GAT)** was introduced by Petar Veličković et al. in 2017. GAT introduces attention mechanisms to graph neural networks, allowing nodes to dynamically weigh the importance of their neighbors during feature aggregation. Unlike GCNs (which treat all neighbors equally), GAT learns to focus on relevant connections. For example, in a social network, your close friends’ opinions might matter more than distant connections.
