# Evolution from Traditional Graph Algorithms to Modern Approaches
Graph representation learning has evolved significantly, shifting from hand-engineered features and matrix factorization to neural network-based inductive methods like GraphSAGE.  
1. **Limitations of Previous Methods (e.g., DeepWalk)** 
   * **No parameter sharing:** Each node's embedding is learned independently, which is inefficient.
   * **No semantic information:** These methods rely solely on graph structure (e.g., random walks) and ignore node features.
   * **Transductive nature:** They cannot generalize to unseen nodes or graphs without retraining.
   * **Approachs such as:**
     * **Random walks:** DeepWalk, Node2Vec (transductive, no parameter sharing).
     * **Matrix factorization:** Eigen decomposition, Laplacian-based methods (e.g., Spectral Clustering).
     * **Handcrafted features:** Degree, centrality, clustering coefficient.
       
2. **Advancements with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**
   * **Parameter sharing:** Convolution operations allow sharing parameters across nodes, improving efficiency.
   * **Semantic information:** By aggregating feature vectors from neighbors, these methods incorporate node features (e.g., text attributes, degrees) into the embeddings.
   * **Approachs such as:**
     * Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Simple Graph Convolution (SGC), and Graph Attention Network (GAT)
   * **Remaining Challenge: Inductive Learning:** Despite the improvements, GCNs and GNNs are still transductive in their original formulations. They require the entire graph during training and cannot generalize to unseen nodes or subgraphs without modification.
       
3. **GraphSAGE as a Solution**
   * **Inductive framework:** GraphSAGE addresses the limitations of earlier methods by introducing an inductive framework that leverages parameter sharing and semantic information (node features). It generalizes to unseen data by learning aggregation functions over local neighborhoods, making it suitable for dynamic or evolving graphs. This represents a significant step forward in graph representation learning, particularly for real-world applications involving unseen nodes or graphs.
