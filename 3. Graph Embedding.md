# Graph Embedding: Mapping Graph Data to Latent Representations
The core objective of embedding is to **transform data** from its original complex space (e.g., graph nodes with irregular connections) into a **simplified, structured latent space (e.g., low-dimensional vectors)** while preserving essential information. This transformation is achieved through an **encoder function**, which maps input data to its embedded representation.
