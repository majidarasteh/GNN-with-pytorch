# Introduction to Graph Theory  

## Definition  
A graph is a structure \( G = (V, E) \), where:  
- \( V \): is a set of vertices (nodes).  
- \( E \): is a set of edges (connections) between nodes.  

## Key Concepts  
1. **Applications**:
   - **Social networks** (nodes = users, edges = friendships)
   - **molecular structures** (nodes = atoms, edges = bonds).
   - **Recommendation systems** (nodes = products/users, edges = interactions). 
2. **Node Degree**:
   - Number of edges connected to it (e.g., in a social network, degree = number of friends).  
3. **Edge Weights**:
   - Numerical values assigned to edges to represent strength, distance, or capacity (e.g., traffic load in road networks).
4. **Degree of a Graph**
   - Maximum degree among all nodes in the graph.
5. **Representations**
   - **Edge List**: Pairs of nodes representing edges, e.g., [(0,1), (1,2)].
   - **Adjacency Matrix**: Square matrix A where Aij=1 if edge (i,j) exists.
6. **Laplacian Matrix**
   - Defined as L=D-A where D is the diagonal degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix.
   - Central to spectral graph theory and graph signal processing.
7. **Node Features**
    - Attributes or vectors associated with each node (e.g., user profiles in social networks, atom properties in molecules).
  
# Why This Matters for GNNs
Graphs provide a natural framework for relational data. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for designing and training GNNs, which operate on graph-structured data by propagating information along edges and transforming node features.
