**Node2Vec** is an advanced graph embedding algorithm that extends DeepWalk by **introducing biased random walks** to better capture both local neighborhood structures and global community patterns in networks. Unlike **DeepWalk's purely random (unbiased) walks**, Node2Vec employs two tunable parameters: **return parameter (p)** and **in-out parameter (q)**, to interpolate between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) behaviors. This allows it to flexibly emphasize either homophily (nodes in the same community) or structural equivalence (nodes with similar roles, e.g., hubs or bridges). By balancing these exploration strategies, Node2Vec generates embeddings that preserve richer network properties, making it particularly effective for tasks like node classification, link prediction, and anomaly detection in complex real-world graphs such as social networks or biological interactions. Its efficiency and interpretable parameters have made it a widely adopted tool in graph machine learning.  

In graph traversal, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** represent two fundamentally different exploration strategies, each offering unique advantages for learning graph representations:  
 - **BFS (Local Exploration):** Explores a node’s immediate neighborhood before moving further away. BFS prioritizes revisiting nearby nodes, making it ideal for capturing local structural patterns (e.g., community membership, direct relationships). For example, in a social network, BFS would emphasize a user’s close friends, making their embeddings reflect tight-knit groups.
 - **DFS (Global Exploration):** Moves as far as possible from the starting node before backtracking. DFS Discovers distant nodes and long-range dependencies, useful for identifying broader community structures or hierarchical roles. For example, in a citation network, DFS might traverse multiple research fields, embedding papers by their thematic connections rather than direct citations.
