Node2Vec is an advanced graph embedding algorithm that extends DeepWalk by introducing biased random walks to better capture both local neighborhood structures and global community patterns in networks. Unlike DeepWalk's purely random (unbiased) walks, Node2Vec employs two tunable parameters—return parameter (p) and in-out parameter (q)—to interpolate between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) behaviors. This allows it to flexibly emphasize either homophily (nodes in the same community) or structural equivalence (nodes with similar roles, e.g., hubs or bridges). By balancing these exploration strategies, Node2Vec generates embeddings that preserve richer network properties, making it particularly effective for tasks like node classification, link prediction, and anomaly detection in complex real-world graphs such as social networks or biological interactions. Its efficiency and interpretable parameters have made it a widely adopted tool in graph machine learning.
