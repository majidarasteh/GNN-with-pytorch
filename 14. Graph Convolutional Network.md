# Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  
the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), introduced by Kipf & Welling in 2016 ("Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"), remains one of the most influential papers in graph representation learning. It laid the foundation for modern Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and inspired many subsequent advancements like GraphSAGE, GAT, and SGC. Key Innovations of GCN are as follow:  
1. **Spectral vs. Spatial Convolution:** Early graph convolutions relied on computationally expensive Fourier transforms in the spectral domain (e.g., Bruna et al., 2013). Kipf & Welling simplified this by proposing a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions, making it efficient and scalable.
2. **Neighborhood Aggregation:** GCN defines a layer-wise propagation rule for node embeddings:

3. **Semi-Supervised Learning** GCN was originally designed for node classification with limited labeled data, leveraging graph structure to propagate labels efficiently.
