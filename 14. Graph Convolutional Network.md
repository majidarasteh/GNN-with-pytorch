# Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)  
the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), introduced by Kipf & Welling in 2016 ("Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"), remains one of the most influential papers in graph representation learning. It laid the foundation for modern Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and inspired many subsequent advancements like GraphSAGE, GAT, and SGC
